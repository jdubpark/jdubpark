I'm a comp sci student at UIUC, born in Korea and lived abroad most of my life. I love blockchain.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning distributed systems & parallel programming. Also diving into the practical applications of zkML!

ðŸ‘¯ I'm in love with the math behind DeFi, but not so much the current state of satured & self-referential DeFi tokenomics. I will never stop praising the beauty of distributed ledger tech and full ownership in blockchain.

ðŸ¤” In my free time, I like to ideate on consumer-friendly Web3 products that abstract away (multi-chain) blockchain, maybe with the help of AI.

ðŸ’» Intern at [Solana Labs](https://solana.com) this summer. Traded at [Diffuse Funds](https://diffusefunds.com), interned at [Runtime Verification](https://runtimeverification.com) and [MYTY](https://myty.space), and won at various [hackathons](https://parkjongwon.com/#projects).
